### Follow these steps to get your TAK Server up and running.

1. Download, install, and run the Docker program from [the Docker website](https://www.docker.com/).
   You may be required to restart your computer at this point.

2. Unzip the **tak_server_configurator.zip** file that was just downloaded.

3. Open Terminal or Command Prompt

4. In the Terminal or Command Prompt, use the Change Directory "**cd**" command to navigate to the _TAK_Server_Configurator_
   folder that was just unzipped (for simplicity, you can copy the file path from the address bar of your file
   browser).

5. Run the configurator script

   a. **Windows** Run the command below in Command Prompt

   ```bat
   ./windows-start-here.bat
   ```

   b. **Linux/Mac** Run the commands below in Terminal

   ```sh
   sudo chmod 755 ./linux-mac-start-here.sh
   ./linux-mac-start-here.sh
   ```

6. **Congratulations!** Your Tak Server is up and running. Next you will need to distribute the user
   certificates from the shared folder and connect your clients.

7. Next, distribute your user certificates and connect your clients.  The certificate YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD_HERE is **atakatak**
